# codedb MCP Setup

`codedb mcp` runs as a stdio JSON-RPC server speaking the
[Model Context Protocol](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/). It exposes
tools for code intelligence — search, outline, callers, dependencies, and
task-shaped context — backed by the indexes in `~/.codedb/projects/<hash>/`.

This guide covers per-client setup, how codedb decides which project to
scan, and the most common failure modes.

> **codedb is a context tool, not an editor.** Its job is to help an agent
> *find and understand* code — fast structural search, symbol/caller lookup,
> dependency graph, outlines, and task-shaped context. Edits belong to your
> client's native file tools; codedb has no edit capability (the old
> `codedb_edit` fallback was removed).

## 1. Quick install

### macOS and Linux (auto-configures detected clients)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://codedb.codegraff.com/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the binary for your platform, drops it in `~/bin`
(or `$CODEDB_DIR` when set), and auto-registers
codedb as an MCP server in every client it can find — Claude Code, Codex,
Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, oh-my-pi, Hermes, Qwen Code, ZCode,
Trae, Cline, Copilot CLI, Antigravity, Kiro, and OpenCode. It prints the exact `codedb mcp` command it
registered. Only clients that already look installed (config dir or CLI on
`PATH`) are touched.

### Windows x86_64 (native)

Run in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justrach/codedb/v0.2.5833/install/install.ps1 | iex
```

The shell installer is for macOS/Linux; running it in WSL installs the Linux binary inside WSL, not the native Windows binary.

If you prefer to wire it up by hand, the client-specific snippets below
all work directly.

---

## 2. Client-specific configuration

All clients launch `codedb mcp` as a stdio child process. Find a global install with `command -v codedb` on macOS/Linux. On Windows, the default path is `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Programs\codedb\codedb.exe`.

The examples below use `/absolute/path/to/codedb`; replace it with the path for your installation. In JSON on Windows, escape backslashes, for example `C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\codedb\\codedb.exe`.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add codedb -s user -- /absolute/path/to/codedb mcp

# Windows PowerShell
claude mcp add codedb -s user -- "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\codedb\codedb.exe" mcp
```

Or edit `~/.claude.json` directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Verify with `claude mcp list`; the `codedb` entry should report `Connected`.

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The tools should appear in the slash-command menu.

### Cursor

Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (per-user) or `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json`
(per-project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Cursor advertises the open workspace via the `roots/list` MCP handshake,
so codedb scans the right project automatically (see Root Resolution
below).

### VS Code (with an MCP extension)

Same `mcpServers` block as Cursor, scoped to whichever extension you use.

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex mcp add codedb -- /absolute/path/to/codedb mcp

# Windows PowerShell
codex mcp add codedb -- "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\codedb\codedb.exe" mcp
```

### Gemini CLI

Edit `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### oh-my-pi

User config is `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json` (or `~/.omp/profiles/<name>/agent/mcp.json`
when a named profile is active):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Hermes

Add a stdio server under `mcp_servers` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  codedb:
    command: "/absolute/path/to/codedb"
    args: ["mcp"]
```

### Qwen Code

Edit `~/.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ZCode

User config is `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` (`mcp.servers`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "codedb": {
        "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
        "args": ["mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Trae / TraeCode

User-level: `~/.trae/mcp.json`. Trae IDE also reads
`~/Library/Application Support/Trae/User/settings/mcp.json` (macOS) or
`%APPDATA%\Trae\User\settings\mcp.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cline

CLI/SDK: `~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`. The VS Code/Cursor
extension uses the same `mcpServers` object in its `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Edit `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, or run
`copilot mcp add codedb -- /absolute/path/to/codedb mcp`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Google Antigravity

Global config is `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (older IDE builds also
read `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Kiro

User config is `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codedb": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/codedb",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenCode

Edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. Current OpenCode uses a `mcp` map
with `type: "local"` and a command array (v2 nested `mcp.servers` is also
accepted):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "codedb": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["/absolute/path/to/codedb", "mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool profile (smaller tools/list)

Agent harnesses default to `CODEDB_TOOLS_PROFILE=mini`: five one-shot tools
(`context`, `explain`, `callpath`, `list_dir`, `status`). Hop tools
(`search` / `symbol` / `callers` / `outline` / `read`) still dispatch when
called by name. Set `CODEDB_TOOLS_PROFILE=core` for the older 10-tool
navigation set, `slim` for the terse hop six, or `full` to advertise every
tool. GUI clients that emit rich blocks keep `full` unless the env var is
set. The profile only changes what's *advertised*.

### DeepWiki (remote, registered by the installer)

The installer also registers [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com) — a free,
no-auth **remote** MCP server (`https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`, streamable
HTTP) — alongside codedb in each detected client. It answers questions
about *public* GitHub repos (`read_wiki_structure`, `read_wiki_contents`,
`ask_question`), which complements codedb's local index of *your* code.

- Registration is additive: an existing `deepwiki` entry in your config is
  never overwritten, and re-running the installer is idempotent.
- The URL field name is per-client (`url` for Cursor, `serverUrl` for
  Windsurf/Devin, `httpUrl` for Gemini, `type: "http"` + `url` for Claude
  Code, `url` in Codex's TOML) — the installer writes the right one.
- Opt out with `CODEDB_INSTALL_DEEPWIKI=0 sh install.sh`.
- Privacy note: DeepWiki is a third-party hosted service — any text you
  send its tools (e.g. `ask_question`) leaves your machine. codedb itself
  stays fully local.

---

## 3. Root resolution — which project does `codedb mcp` scan?

`codedb mcp` figures out the project root in this order (first match wins):

1. **MCP `roots/list` handshake** (preferred). When a client supports it
   (Cursor, Windsurf, recent VS Code MCP extensions), codedb requests
   `roots/list` immediately after `initialize` and uses the first workspace
   root the client returns. This is the most reliable path — codedb scans
   exactly the project the user has open in their editor.

2. **Per-call `project` argument**. Every tool accepts an optional
   `project: "<abs path>"` field that switches the active project for that
   single call. Useful for cross-project queries:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "codedb_search",
     "arguments": {
       "query": "scheduleUpdateOnFiber",
       "project": "/Users/me/code/react"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Process `cwd`**. If the client doesn't speak `roots/list` and no
   per-call `project` is set, codedb falls back to the directory it was
   launched from. Some editors launch MCP servers from `/Applications` or
   `~`, which is almost certainly the wrong directory — set the `project`
   arg explicitly for those.

System directories (`/`, `/Applications`, `/usr`, `/opt`, `~`,
`/tmp`, etc.) are blocked from being indexed as project roots — see
[`docs/rfc-346-mcp-root-resolution.md`](rfc-346-mcp-root-resolution.md)
for the full safety logic.

---

## 4. `.codedbrc` — per-project configuration

Drop a `.codedbrc` at the root of any project to override defaults for
that project. INI-style `key = value` pairs, one per line, `#` for
comments. Unknown keys are ignored.

```ini
# .codedbrc
max_cached   = 16384   # in-memory ContentCache size (files); default 16384
max_versions = 100     # versions kept per file in the change log; default 100
max_watched  = 1024    # macOS vnode-FD ceiling; 0 = polling only
rerank_trace = false   # write per-search rerank-trace.jsonl (debug only)
```

Pass an alternative path with `--config-file <path>` to the CLI for
testing.

---

## 5. Verifying the install

```bash
codedb --version          # codedb 0.2.5815 (or later)
codedb status             # one-line: indexed file count + scan phase
```

In a client, the simplest tool to smoke-test is `codedb_status` — it
takes no arguments and returns `files: N, seq: N, scan: ready` in <50 ms.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### "No project root yet" / empty tree

The MCP server hasn't received a project root. Either:
- the client doesn't speak `roots/list`, or
- the client launched codedb from a system directory that's blocked from
  indexing (`/Applications`, `/usr`, `~`, etc.).

**Fix:** pass `project: "/abs/path/to/your/project"` on the first tool
call, or restart the client from inside the project directory.

### `codedb_find` returns `missing 'query'`

Fixed in v0.2.5815 — `codedb_find` now accepts `query`, `name`, `path`,
`pattern`, and `q` as aliases. If you're still seeing this error,
`codedb --version` will show < 0.2.5815; rerun the installer.

### Tools list looks short / `codedb_context` is missing

`codedb_context` was added in **v0.2.5815**. Older binaries expose only
20 tools. On macOS/Linux, upgrade with `codedb update` (or the installer one-liner above). On Windows, rerun the verified PowerShell installer and verify with `codedb --version`.

### Snapshot indexer keeps re-scanning

The watcher debounces filesystem events for ~500 ms. If your editor saves
files in quick succession (e.g. a formatter that rewrites everything),
back-to-back saves can extend the scan phase. Check `codedb status` —
`scan: ready` means it's caught up.

### Permission errors on macOS

The first time you run a fresh codedb binary on macOS, Gatekeeper may
quarantine it. Apple Silicon release binaries from v0.2.5811+ are signed
with a Developer ID and notarized via Apple — verify with:

```bash
codesign -vvvv -R='notarized' --check-notarization /usr/local/bin/codedb
# expected: valid on disk; explicit requirement satisfied
```

`codedb` is a bare Mach-O command-line executable, so Apple's verification
procedure for “other code” uses `codesign --check-notarization`; `spctl -t
install` is for installer packages and can incorrectly report this artifact as
unnotarized. Bare Mach-O files cannot carry a stapled ticket, so this check uses
Apple's online ticket lookup.

From 0.2.5833 the Intel `codedb-darwin-x86_64` slice is codesigned and
notarized again. Earlier releases shipped it unsigned: the pinned Zig
toolchain reserved no Mach-O headerpad, so codesign's appended
LC_CODE_SIGNATURE overwrote `__text` and signed binaries crashed on launch
(#504, #618); the build now reserves headerpad explicitly.

If you built from source on Apple Silicon, codesign the binary locally:

```bash
codesign --force --sign - /usr/local/bin/codedb
```

Avoid codesigning locally built x86_64-macos binaries on macOS 26 until
the upstream Zig/Mach-O issue is resolved.

### Stale signatures after `cp` over an existing binary

macOS caches codesignatures by path. After replacing the binary,
re-codesign Apple Silicon builds or the MCP server may fail to launch:

```bash
codesign --force --sign - /usr/local/bin/codedb
```

The installer does this for you.

## 7. Response verbosity — lean vs rich (token cost)

Every MCP tool result carries the data block the model consumes
(`audience: assistant`). Interactive clients also get two `audience: user`
blocks: a colored one-line summary and a follow-up hint. Well-behaved clients
render those in a preview pane and keep them out of the model context — but
many forward everything to the model, where they cost output tokens for output
the model can't render (they add ~34% to a small result like `codedb_symbol`).

codedb decides per session, from the `clientInfo.name` sent at `initialize`:

- **Agent harnesses default lean** (data block only) — `claude-code`, `codex`,
  and any client not on the rich allowlist.
- **Human-facing GUI clients get the rich blocks** — currently `claude-ai`
  (Claude Desktop).

Override the default:

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CODEDB_MCP_LEAN=1` | Force lean for every client (data block only). |
| `CODEDB_MCP_RICH=1` | Force rich for every client. |
| `CODEDB_MCP_RICH_CLIENTS=name1,name2` | Add clients (by `clientInfo.name`, case-insensitive) to the rich allowlist. |

`CODEDB_MCP_LEAN` takes precedence over `CODEDB_MCP_RICH`.

## 8. Going deeper

- [Architecture](architecture.md) — engine internals, index layout
- [CLI reference](cli.md) — every command, every flag
- [Skill base & context files](skills.md) — `agents.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `GEMINI.md`, and the per-project skill hierarchy
- [RFC #346 — MCP root resolution](rfc-346-mcp-root-resolution.md) —
  full design + safety logic for project-root detection
- [Telemetry](telemetry.md) — what codedb sends, how to disable

## Experimental lazy startup

Set `CODEDB_LAZY_MCP=1` in your client's codedb MCP server environment, preserving
existing entries, then reconnect the server. Installers do not enable this
experimental option. Remove the variable to restore eager startup; setting it
to `0` still enables it.

```bash
CODEDB_LAZY_MCP=1 codedb /path/to/project mcp
```

Initialization, tool discovery, ping, `codedb_status`, and `codedb_projects`
leave the default project idle (`scan: idle`). The first code request without
an explicit `project` starts snapshot loading, scanning, and normal watching.
Requests with `project` continue through the existing project cache. Explicit
positional roots retain precedence over client roots.

The first default-project request waits up to 30 seconds for scan readiness,
then returns a retry error if initialization is still running. Clients that poll
status before requesting code must handle the idle state. Connections stay open;
watchers continue normally once started.

Lazy sessions skip speculative warmup and the MCP process's CLI proxy. CLI calls
use their existing standalone/daemon fallback, which can increase startup cost.
This option helps sessions that never query code; it does not share worktree
indexes, consolidate processes, change retrieval ranking, or reduce active
watcher work.
